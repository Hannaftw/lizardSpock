      <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p id="infoText">
        The game made "famous" by the tv-series The Big Bang Theory is
        incredibly confusing and I could never remember what will win over what?
        I think there are many who, like me, wanted to play the game but had no
        interest or patience to memorize the rules. So is created this fantastic
        version where you can play in solitude, against AI because that's how
        your future will look anyway, no people needed, huzzah... <br>
        And there was much rejoicing... <br>
        But there was need of more commits... <br>
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rock crushes Scissors: <em>Rock wins against Scissors.</em></li>
        <li>Scissors cuts Paper: <em>Scissors win against Paper.</em></li>
        <li>Paper covers Rock: <em>Paper wins against Rock.</em></li>
        <li>Rock crushes Lizard: <em>Rock wins against Lizard.</em></li>
        <li>Lizard poisons Spock: <em>Lizard wins against Spock.</em></li>
        <li>Spock smashes Scissors: <em>Spock wins against Scissors.</em></li>
        <li>Scissors decapitates Lizard: <em>Scissors win against Lizard.</em></li>
        <li>Lizard eats Paper: <em>Lizard wins against Paper.</em></li>
        <li>Paper disproves Spock: <em>Paper wins against Spock.</em></li>
        <li>Spock vaporizes Rock: <em>Spock wins against Rock.</em></li>
